# Lincoln-Fencing-Club-Strip-Layout
A description of the electrical layout of the Lincoln Fencing Club

Of note, only older versions of the D1 Mini will work. There was a chip change in a revision that no longer will properly read serial from the Favero scoring machine without modification. In my experience, Wemos D1 Mini without the phrase "D1 mini" silk screened on the board in the corner opposite the antenna will work. Future revisions will use the ESP_32 for parsing and transmitting.
